      <div><h2>WHAT TO DO</h2><p> WHEN IMMIGRATION SHOWS UP AT YOUR DOOR.</p> <p>1. Stay calm. </p> <p>2. Make sure to keep your door closed and ask, through the closed door, who they are or what they are here for. </p> <p>3. Ask if they have a warrant. If they have one, ask them to slide it under the door. There are 2 types of warrants that they may have: </p>  <p>a. An Arrest Warrant. </p> <p>Allows ICE or the police to arrest you and check your immediate body. They are not allowed to enter or search your home. </p> <p>b. A Search Warrant</p> <p> Allows officers to come into your home and search the premises. </p> <p> 4. Check the line where the signature is supposed to be and make sure it is signed by a judge him/herself. If it is signed by anyone else, simply state "I do not authorize your entry." Also, make sure your name is on it or the owner of the homes name is there. If they forcefully enter, remember you have the right to remain silent. Make sure that those around you do the same. Do not show false papers or anything, remain silent and ask to talk to a lawyer. </p> <p> 5.  Do not sign any documents that are given to you . Continue to ask for a lawyer until one is given to you. </p> <p> WHEN A PERSON OF AUTHORITY ASK FOR YOUR STATUS </p> <p> 1. You have the right to remain silent and do not have to show them anything. </p> <p> 2. If they continue to ask you for then, ask them â€œAm I being arrested if they say no, you can walk away freely </p>
