                <h2>CHILDREN</h2>
                <p>Children of immigrants tend to do better in school than children of native-born Americans. On average their grades are higher and their rates of graduation are higher, when compared with the rest of the school population.</p>
                <p>  These students may lack the educational background often present in American students.
Because of this, students may enter Kindergarten with much lower skills in math than any other.</p>
                <p>With regards to school, parents often feel disappointed to see their children struggling to keep up in class, and many parents report bullying and discrimination as a result of cultural differences. Kids are often placed by their age rather than by their ability, and for those who are unable to speak English, it&#39;s virtually impossible to keep up. To add further insult to injury, parents may not have the education or language skills to assist their children, and they may not be able to communicate with faculty to address the problem.

                <h2>DACA</h2>
                <p>Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is a kind of administrative relief from deportation. The purpose of DACA is to protect eligible immigrant youth who came to the United States when they were children from deportation. DACA
                  gives young undocumented immigrants protection from deportation, and a work permit. More than half a million people have applied for DACA through June 2013; 72 percent have been approved, while just 1 percent have been denied. </p>
                <p> Students who are accepted to college then must find a way to pay for it. If they cannot prove legal residency in a state, they must pay much higher out-of-state or international-student tuition rates, without the assistance of financial aid </p>
               <p> DACA helps with all of these issues by providing protection from deportation, a social security number, a work permit and the ability to obtain a driver&#39;s license. These resources enable students to apply for financial support to attend college, obtain health insurance, open bank accounts and provide for their families by accessing jobs previously unavailable to them.</p>

                <h2>LEARNING</h2>
                <p>The United States, is not known for being multilingual. So imagine arriving here, unable to speak English. Try getting a job, making friends, or even completing basic tasks like buying food or filling out forms.

To address this, many refugees and immigrants take ESL classes, but finding the time between jobs and caring for kids can be difficult. Especially difficult if you weren&#39;t literate in your native tongue to begin with.
                </p>
                <p> Many of the new arrivals don&#39;t speak much English and are behind academically. They often come with scars, having fled desperate poverty or violence or both. Many endured difficult journeys, sometimes leaving their families behind or rejoining parents in the United States after years of separation. And U.S. schools, already strapped for resources, are trying to provide special services, including &#183; English-language instruction and mental-health care.</p>
                <p>The schools have to, because it&#39;s the law: Children who are living in this country have a right to a public education, regardless of their immigration status. But for many educators it&#39;s also more than a legal obligation, it&#39;s the moral thing to do.</p>

                <h2>SCHOLARSHIPS</h2>
                <p> There are specific organizations such as TheDream.Us that help immigrant youth and undocumented students who have received DACA status achieve their American Dream through the completion of a college education. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund also provides students a scholarship program, regardless of their immigration status, as long as students can demonstrate a commitment to advancing Latino civil rights through their career.</p>

<p>Not only do such organizations provide scholarship programs and opportunities, but they also have education resources based on your state - be sure to check your current or prospective college's scholarship and financial aid opportunities to help fund your college education. You may need to conduct some personal research and stay updated on immigration policies, as they are constantly fluctuating and may have some gray areas. Even if a state does not have a DREAM Act, schools may offer merit scholarships that are not tied to federal funding. And remember to conduct a free search to see what scholarships you may be eligible for.
